Urho3D uses the following conventions and principles:

Left-handed coordinates. Positive X, Y & Z axes point to the right, up, and forward, and positive rotation is clockwise.
Degrees are used for angles.
Clockwise vertices define a front face.
Audio volume is specified from 0.0 (silence) to 1.0 (full volume)
Path names use slash instead of backslash. Paths will be converted internally into the necessary format when calling into the operating system.
In the script API, properties are used whenever appropriate instead of Set... and Get... functions. If the setter and getter require index parameters, the property will use array-style indexing, and its name will be in plural. For example model->SetMaterial(0, myMaterial) in C++ would become model.materials[0] = myMaterial in script.
Raw pointers are used whenever possible in the classes' public API. This simplifies exposing functions & classes to script, and is relatively safe, because SharedPtr & WeakPtr use intrusive reference counting.
No C++ exceptions. Error return values (false / null pointer / dummy reference) are used instead. Script exceptions are used when there is no other sensible way, such as with out of bounds array access.
Feeding illegal data to public API functions, such as out of bounds indices or null pointers, should not cause crashes or corruption. Instead errors are logged as appropriate.
Third party libraries are included as source code for the build process. They are however hidden from the public API as completely as possible.
