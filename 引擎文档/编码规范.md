Indent style is Allman (BSD) -like, ie. brace on the next line from a control statement, indented on the same level. In switch-case statements the cases are on the same indent level as the switch statement.
Indents use 4 spaces instead of tabs.
Class and struct names are in camelcase beginning with an uppercase letter. They should be nouns. For example DebugRenderer, FreeTypeLibrary, Graphics.
Functions are likewise in upper-camelcase. For example CreateComponent, SetLinearRestThreshold.
Variables are in lower-camelcase. Member variables have an underscore appended. For example numContacts, randomSeed_.
Constants and enumerations are in uppercase. For example Vector3::ZERO or PASS_SHADOW.
Pointers and references append the * or & symbol to the type without a space in between. For example Drawable* drawable, Serializer& dest.
Class definitions proceed in the following order:
public constructors and the destructor
public virtual functions
public non-virtual member functions
public static functions
public member variables
public static variables
repeat all of the above in order for protected definitions, and finally private
Header files are commented using one-line comments beginning with /// to mark them for Doxygen.
Inline functions are defined inside the class definitions where possible, without using the inline keyword.
